# E-COMMERCE_website_using_MERN_FULL_STACK

This project is not completed yet. Only back-end part is completed.(using nodejs,expressjs,routes,middlewares,postman,mongoDB,controllers,models,other dependencies like lodash,validator etc)  I am still working in this project. Now, My target is to make front end or client side using REACT JS framework. I will concurrently connect front end and backend together.
